## Data Visualization
Here is an image that demonstrates the amount of dogs living all around Cambridge.

In the visualization below, you are able to see a visual representation of the amount of dogs in each neighborhood of Cambridge. The bigger squares correlate to neighborhoods with a larger dog population, and vice-versa. Additionally, the darekr the shade of blue that the sqaures are, the more densely populated that neighborhood is with dogs. For an example, you can tell that out of all of Cambridge, MA, the West Cambridge neighborhood has the most amount of dogs because it is the biggest square and is the darkest color of blue.

This visualization was crate using a workbook in the data software *Tableau*.
